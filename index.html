                                My journey to web development began when I was in high school and I became interested in computer technology.  During 
                                this time we had a computer in the house, but it was used by my father for work and the extent of it's usefulness was
                                basically word processing and simple spreadsheets.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I had some friends that were getting the latest generation computers of the time that had advanced technology which
                                made the computing experience a far more interesting and entertaining one.  Intel 386/486 CPUs, SVGA video, external
                                sound cards and 2400 baud modems changed my life.  Hanging out with these friends consisted of exploring the
                                capabilities of these new glorious machines of the time and soon I started learning DOS commands, writing batch files
                                and dialing into BBSs.  I also starting taking apart the old computer in the house as we were about to get a new
                                generation computer or our own.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After high school I was still undecided on which direction to go with life so I signed up with a temp agency doing
                                data entry.  I had taken a typing class as an elective and was able to make decent money using this new skill while
                                also being a part of an office environment where I was hoping to figure out what I wanted to do.  This went on for a
                                few years until the company I had been at was ending their project term and the agency wasn't able to find me steady 
                                work.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                At this time a friend of mine had just gotten a job at UPS as a package handler and said the money was decent and
                                steady so I decided to give it a shot.  It was another temp to hire situation so I gave the agency a call.  What
                                happened next would be the beginning of my career in computer technology.  During my interview with the agency they
                                learned I had computer knowledge and could type fast so they put me up at a local UPS tech support center instead of
                                a package center where I was expecting to land.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I soon became a f/t employee with UPS and moved up to full support technican quickly where I assisted fellow UPS 
                                employees in the field with their computer and in-house technology issues, among other tasks.  By this time I had 
                                bought my first computer, became a Windows power user via 95 & NT 4.0 and was well into computer hardware and 
                                networking.  I started studying for my A+ certification, but ended up just reading as much as I could for the 
                                knowledge more than the certification.  I also fell into a second job during this time with a friend's father that 
                                was a programmer and had his own business.  I soon found myself setting up computers and networks during the day and 
                                supporting UPS employees at night.  
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My family had moved to Florida during this time, away from where generations had called home, Chicago.  I soon 
                                followed and moved to Orlando to get an education. This started a tumultuous time of trying to decide which path to 
                                follow that involed on/off schooling of different focus as well as continuing my career in computer technology.  I 
                                came out with an AA degree that included a focus on math and science as well as a decision to just stay with the 
                                career in computer technology.  It was also during this time that I discovered the joy of programming during a C 
                                language class I had taken and loved.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The financial situation had again become something that needed to be addressed, but we were in the midst of a 
                                terrible economy so finding a decent job was not easy.  After months of looking I eventually landed with a company
                                that would see me not only find my way in the world of technology, but would also provide a stable near 10 year 
                                career in which I moved up the ranks to project manager.  Sadly, about a quarter away from my 10 year anniversary 
                                with the company they were bought out and began layoffs in my sector, leaving me withour a job in almost a decade.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                During the last few years of the longest job I had ever held, I was being reimbursed for taking classes for an AS
                                degree in computer programming and analysis. After working alongside our development team I realized that was what
                                I wanted to be doing, I remembered again how much I enjoyed that class in C.  After I was laid off I began looking 
                                briefly for a position as a project manager before I realized it wasn't the path I wanted to follow.  I was soon 
                                turned on to the UCF bootcamp for web development and knew this was the right thing to do and the right time to do 
                                it.
